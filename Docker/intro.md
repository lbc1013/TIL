## What is Docker..?
Docker is an open source platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications. It enables developers to package applications into containers—standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

Potential environment differences (local machine vs. cloud instance) that affect application development and deployment:

- Hardware
- Operating system
- File structure (assets)
- Node installation
- DBMS installation
- IP

#### Containerization :
 The idea of grouping together of containers designed to consistently spin up and run your application code in a reliable manner.
#### Container :
 A “computer” that specifies and houses the code needed to run your application consistently within containerization software.
